Undo/Redo-
- our undo and redo commands work within only the same player's move

Hard AI-
- this AI takes into account the player to their left's stock pile
- depending on the difference between its and the left player's stock
  pile sizes, it will choose different strategies depending on how
  aggressive it needs to play
- the different levels of aggression dictates if the primary goal is to
  block their opponent or get rid of stock pile cards
- the strategies were developed by playing several Skip-Bo games with large
  number of players and seeing what went through each player's mind with
  each of their moves
- we tested the AI strategies in real life by having one player strictly
  play by the AI rules and he won consistently
